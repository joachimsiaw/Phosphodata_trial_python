# V. leishmania 
Data represnts Differentially expressed (DE) genes in v. between V. leishmania patients and controls

#This script analyses  the fold change in gene expression
#Prints out separate lists of down and up regulated genes
#plots graph of genes vs fold change with fold change >=abs 1.5
#Plot graphs of top10 mnost upregulatd and top 10 most downregulated DE genes
