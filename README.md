# Phosphodata_trial_python
Phosphoproteomics data: 

#This script analyses  the log fold changes in the phosphorylation status of proteins.

#The script prints separate lists of proteins whose phosphorylation status decreased or increased upon treatment (fold change < or > 0).

# The script then prints list of proteins with fold change  greater than -1.5 or 1.5
